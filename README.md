# URL-Shortener
I've created a URL shortener project using Spring Boot, integrating key concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to provide efficient and scalable URL shortening functionality. Leveraging Spring Boot's robust framework, the project offers a reliable and maintainable solution for generating and managing shortened URLs. Through the application of DSA principles, such as hash tables the project ensures fast lookup and retrieval of original URLs, optimizing performance even with a large number of entries. This project showcases my ability to apply DSA concepts in real-world applications and my proficiency in Spring Boot development.
